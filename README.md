This initiative is part of the ALX curriculum project, presenting an interactive shell to manage instances of various classes such as User, amenity, city, place, state, review, and the BaseModel, serving as the foundation for all other classes.
## Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter plays a pivotal role in the Airbnb Console Clone project, offering users an interactive shell to engage with the application. It acts as a textual interface through which users can input commands to execute a range of operations, encompassing the creation, display, modification, and removal of instances across diverse classes.
### Key Features:

- **User-friendly-interface:** The command interpreter provides simple and user-friendly interface, facilitating smooth navigation and execution of commands for users.
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can effortlessly carry out operations of Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion on instances of various classes present in the application (User, Amenity, City, State, Review, and BaseModel).
- **Dynamic handling:** - The interpreter dynamically manages various classes, enabling users to interact with multiple models like BaseModel and User.
